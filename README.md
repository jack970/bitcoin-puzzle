## What's Bitcoin Puzzle?

In 2015, in order to show the hugeness of the private key space (or maybe just for fun), someone created a "puzzle" where he chose keys in a certain smaller space and sent increasing amounts to each of those keys like this:

20 ≤ random key < 21 — 0.001 BTC
21 ≤ random key < 22 — 0.002 BTC
23 ≤ random key < 23 — 0.003 BTC
...
2255 ≤ random key < 2256 — 0.256 BTC
(total 32.896 BTC)

First 65 and #70, #75, #80, #85, #90, #95, #100, #105, #110, #115, #120, #125 private keys have already been cracked.
